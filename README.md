- Power Query
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Microsoft Excel
- GitHub

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of student academic details such as branch, CGPA, gender, and graduation year, along with placement information including placement status, company, job role, and salary package.

## Dashboard Overview
The Power BI dashboard presents key metrics such as placement percentage, average and highest salary packages, branch-wise placement performance, and company-wise hiring trends. Interactive filters allow users to analyze data across different branches, years, and placement statuses.
